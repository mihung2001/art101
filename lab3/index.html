		<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer </h1>

		<p id = "subject">

			The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the github server.

		</p>

		<h2> Challenges </h2>

		<p id = "challenges">

			There were no challenges when it came to creating the file structure since it was already done for me since I used the template that Professor Wes provided. Creating the index.html files were painless since there Atom can create a HTML file template for the user.

		</p>

		<h2>Results </h2>

		<p id = "results">

			The results of this lab is a file structure that allows me to find and access files, folders, etc. in a fast and easy manner. The lab showed me how to be organized when it comes to files for large projects like this.
			Below is a screenshot of what the file structure looks like:
