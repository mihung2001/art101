// Drawing the Human Figure:
// 1. Get a piece of paper or anything to draw on such as a tablet, etc.
// 2. Lightly draw the strongest direction or gesture of the pose you're going for.
// 3. Then, lightly block in the head, torso, pelvis, legs, etc.
//    - Don't care about the details, only focus on the bigger picture or the structure of the body like how you do.
//    - Think of this step as the HTML and the details as css
// 4. After blocking in the main structures, lightly sketch secondary structures such as the eyes, mouth, muscles, glasses, clothes, etc.
// 5. Then, shade in the third structures such as details like veins, textures, creases, etc.
// 6. After blocking in everything, render the drawing and make it clean by shading stuff in or making things or 3-dimensional.
// 7. Finished!

//Creating a webpage:
//  1. Create a text document
//  2. Edit the text file with a text editor.
//  3. Type “<!DOCTYPE html> at the top of the document
//  4. Underneath the previous step type “<html> </html>”.
//      - Put your cursor in between the opening and closing tag and hit return/enter key on your keyboard to make the closing tag go below the opening tag.
//  5. In between the html tags type “<body> </body>” .
//      - Put your cursor in between the opening and closing tag and hit return/enter key on your keyboard to make the closing tag go below the opening tag.
//  6. In between the body tags type “<p> </p>”.
//      - In between the p tags type whatever you want.
//  7. Close the text file and rename it “index.html”.
//  8. View the index.html file in your browser to see if it works.
